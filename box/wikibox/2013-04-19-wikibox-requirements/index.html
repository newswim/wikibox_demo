	<p id="page-entry"> <h1>Background</h1>

<p>After years of searching, learning, twisting and hacking software for my personal knowledge I decided to finally design my own, which will perfectly fit all of my needs.</p>

<p>As a developer always wanting to support other developers and knowing about the needed continuous effort for keeping up a software system to be used in permanent production this decision doesn't come easy.</p>

<p>I felt often dangled with</p>

<ul>
<li>too inflexible or too limited usage opportunities,</li>
<li>waiting for needed features to be developed and finally released,</li>
<li>proprietary file formats, consumed system memory and CPU usage,</li>
<li>closed systems aiming to build its own ecosystems to lock you inside etc.</li>
<li>(see also Alex Paynes fantastic write up against all-in-systems).</li>
</ul>


<p>So I used to often switch systems (having tested probably 30 wikis itself) and permanently and desperately ended up wasting a lot of time for maintenance and transformation.</p>

<p>One day I found M. Douglas Write up about his information system, called . I liked the ideas since I had a lot of similar once in the last years.</p>

<p>Afterwards I also read Amber Vs comments in Scrivener Forums. Read Seth Brown Conclusion and own system approach, it was settled and I switched. I built my own file-convention-system and
used tools like command-line grep .... or notational velocity to keep up with it.</p>

<p>Since I also rediscovered index cards thanks to Pile Of Index Cards. (Long forgotten, last seen/used in the 5th grad.) I started using this system with physical cards.</p>

<p>I know had 2 very different systems, also counting taskpaper (switch away from all proprietary task management systems quite some while ago) and evernote (the only all-in-box left due to snappy search of scanned documents and screenshots for my paperless office) and taskpaper, even 4 systems.</p>

<p>Having used a lot of information systems and currently using a Michale Douglas information system and PoIC for quite some time now, the requirements for the new system are very high since I didn't want to loose the greatness I already have.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>Open System</li>
<li>Easy to adapt to and migrate away from.</li>
<li>Keep advantages of cli and alfred usability of old system based on M. Douglas system.</li>
<li>in cooperate images and file attachments but not depend on them</li>
<li>avoid the pain points of enterprise wikis (confluence, sharepoint, docuwiki etc.)</li>
<li>save resources and keep the production code as small as possible (suckless software)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Foundation</h1>

<p>With the arise of systems like jekyll that patchwork a lot of differnt technologies for processing plaintext files of a hugh vareitey of formats with the easyness of styling via css-languages and some basic templateing (Shopify Liquid is still quite small and inflexible compared to Jinja or Rails or Django) the idea to not start from scratch was easily made.</p>

<p>In fact for the moment I stick with jekyll since you can run everything also as public website via github pages very smoothly.</p>
